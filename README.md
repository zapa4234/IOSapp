# IOSapp
final project for ios/swift class

our idea is to create an app using an api full of recipes with lists of ingredients in which the user enters what ingredients they have, then the app gives all various options and different types of dishes that can be made with the given ingredients. 

we included the twitter login in which once the user finished the dish, they can take a pic and send a tweet via twitter API to let others know how that dish was, to cook and taste how good it was.
